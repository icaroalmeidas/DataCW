very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31zOsqQOAOL._SY445_SX342_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Ambrane-Unbreakable-Charging-Braided-Cable/dp/B098NS6PVG/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,

Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ¹99/- with the offers and so I wasnt sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhones battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ¹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesnt tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesnt get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31VzNhhqifL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-POR-1080-Charging-Function/dp/B08CF3B7N1/ref=sr_1_5?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-5;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,
This is perfect device to connect wifi. Go for it.,This wifi adopter is good working,(Pictures attached)Size/Design:      Build Quality:     Packaging:      Software:     Speed:      Connectivity:      Experience:      Warranty:      Size and Design:The best part about this is that it is very compact in size and very sober and elegant in design. This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever. Works nicely seemless connectivity,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31e6ElWRymL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-TL-WN725N-150Mbps-Wireless-Adapter/dp/B008IFXQFU/ref=sr_1_10?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-10;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,

 same should have been mentioned. When we pay for hi quality products, we expect a certain quality! I still have no idea if this is a hi speed 4k cable or not.,Good,Bought to connect my CP monitor (CCTV) to MI android TV.. .. OK quality at this price,I give it a 5 on 5, reasons as below..1. Amazon delivery - Super fast, same day delivery within 4-5 Hours.2. The delivery person was good.3.  Robust Built Quality, looks & feels premium.4. It is working excellent, I'm using for lapptop to big screen TV connectivity, and could see the undistorted picture and sound, nicely doing its work.A few words of cons..1. Feels a little hard to adjust and bend as per requirement, less flexible. But this may not be a serious concern.Overall a nice experience so far.,Good job,Like.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41da4tk7N+L._SY300_SX300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/TIZUM-Slim-1-5m-HDMI-Cable/dp/B01M4GGIVU/ref=sr_1_27?qid=1672909125&s=electronics&sr=1-27;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 and it does the same job as the original one.,Useful for c type charging. But not suitable with all adapters or USB points. Serves the purpose.,Sturdily built. Does its job well.

 instead it remains yellow. As far as screen is concerned, the tv's screen changes to black whitish, seems to me that the tv goes into hibernation or sleep mode. This is a fault of the tv as a normal tv should swith off completely and the indicator should turn red. i have called technician tomorrow and if he checks and if he agrees, then i should get a replacement as i got still 2 days time to replace it.Just a helping note for people buying this tv: if you are going to connect firestick to it, as it asks for the brand name of the tv, you can select VU and it will perfectly work on your firestick.

 some jitter problems did exist.,This is perfect device to connect wifi.

This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever.

Short review:This eliminates a need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation. Compact and powerful. Best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanks.[Price bought at: ¹309]_______________________________________________________________________________________Long review:I used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it won't come in the way while turning. After being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars, I wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle. This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn't charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use, the charging rate used to be low.That is when I have decided to give this one a try as I was always hesitant that ¹300+ for a short cable is too high. Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality, the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid. As I am going to use it only on the motorcycle, I am sure I will put it through some abuse and I can comment on the same when I revisit this review for updates.Durability:I will have to use it more and update this review on the durability perspective, as my first Wayona dash charge cable I used for Oneplus 6 died in 3 months. But thankfully it was replaced under warranty. That shows how good the support is from Wayona team. I only had to record that the cable died and doesn't charge any more and they too that video as evidence to replace the product.Verdict:If you are looking for a short cable for mobiles on  or for charging devices from powerbanks, I would definitely recommend this cable.,Data transfer is quite fast, and also, compatible with my QC adapter.,Good,Excellent...

 the tv's screen changes to black whitish, seems to me that the tv goes into hibernation or sleep mode. This is a fault of the tv as a normal tv should swith off completely and the indicator should turn red. i have called technician tomorrow and if he checks and if he agrees, then i should get a replacement as i got still 2 days time to replace it.Just a helping note for people buying this tv: if you are going to connect firestick to it, as it asks for the brand name of the tv, you can select VU and it will perfectly work on your firestick.

Very good quality and finish. The cable could have been thicker. However solves the purpose of connecting your device to external source.

Has long charge. Phone finder,  phone camera shutter are good features. Beautiful looking watch.Cons: Not a full screen display, display is smaller than the watch. My watch is not center alligned. Limited number of watch face. Sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch. Phone book should be a little larger than 8 numbers.,Just bought it ,so my review is basically the first impression.I will write a detailed review after few days of use. I like the style and it looks good. So far touch operation is also good,It's good product in this range because I have one more of pebble smart watch in same price range but after using fire boltt it's better. Only one issue that not stop call ring during office or meeting time.,I liked Everything except Hearbeat and O2 Level accuracy but it's close to real levels so average in this respect. Otherwise it's a kill for the money !!! Very good overall.,The product is good as per the price charged. One feedback to supplier to improve the glass of watch, there are lots of scratches within one month of usage.,All is good. Satisfied. Auto selection of sport mode is not there.

very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31zOsqQOAOL._SY445_SX342_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Ambrane-Unbreakable-Charging-Braided-Cable/dp/B098NS6PVG/ref=sr_1_46?qid=1672895755&s=electronics&sr=1-46;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,

Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ¹99/- with the offers and so I wasnt sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhones battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ¹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesnt tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesnt get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31VzNhhqifL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-POR-1080-Charging-Function/dp/B08CF3B7N1/ref=sr_1_62?qid=1672895762&s=electronics&sr=1-62;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,

This is good mobile stand. Sturdy with mobiles but not sure about tablets. Looks good on the desk but not very much attractive as per its design.Unless you are not concerned more about look of the stand and want it for your mobile then, this will be good for you.,Nice product,This is very useful product..nd easy to use ..so I like it,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61V3BAUrbiL._SY88.jpg,The stand is okay for the price. Doesnt look very fine, in fact looks a bit old even when brand new. The band name is also not imprinted clearly. Looks cheap, but did its job okay. I got it for ¹89 in a deal.Sometimes the mic gets blocked and the phone has to be adjusted a little out of the stand. Overall worth the buy,Product Material - full PlasticQuality - 7 out of 10,Fantastic product,  affordable,  makes work more comfort  =L ....Really I'm using it since a month, no issues and complaints...It's quality is not reduced with time....  I think everyone need to buy....For the 1st time I'm giving a review of a product... after some 100s of products I bought here.... think how much I'm satisfies with this cute little thing.....,The product is not the best but a better option at that price range. Bought it for just 119 rupees,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31iE517+NFL._SY300_SX300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/STRIFF-Mobile-Android-Samsung-OnePlus/dp/B07GXHC691/ref=sr_1_73?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-73;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
  the first thing it did was to update the firmware.I love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 4.4K against an MRP of 16K. The do sound very good but does not suit my taste.  Persons loving bass may love them. Don't get them for ANC. Battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. It has wireless charging too. If your ears are too small or too large than normal - better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,Best call quality. Noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.Descent battery life.Music is good. Not to that top notch, but good in this segment.Overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,I am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,Bluetooth range is not that good,The sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. I got these for Rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until I faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. The bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. It feels like I am using bluetooth v3.0. The range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. The mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. I think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphone's quality. If you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. Samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. I pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product. Even at Rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue. It is better to buy a wired IEM, atleast it will sound better than this.,In this price Samsung brand is goodEasy to wear and good battery backupHardly support the 2 meter Bluetooth connectivity,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Sx7+mu+vL._SY300_SX300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-R180NZKAINU-Mystic-Black/dp/B08FN6WGDQ/ref=sr_1_74?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-74;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41d84o5-M-L._SY445_SX342_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Ambrane-Unbreakable-Charging-Braided-Cable/dp/B082LSVT4B/ref=sr_1_141?qid=1672895784&s=electronics&sr=1-141;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,
I have been using this watch since a month and its really great. All features are working quite well and connectivity with phone is also good.Screen quality may be improved.,Actually my smart watch BSW043 Ring 3 is not charging 2 to 3 days. It's off I tired to msg fireballs but it alway say to follow our page on Instagram. And when we follow its shows you their new offers. I don't know what to do now. I just submitted the warranty form.,The watch worked for the 2-3 Months and got switched off automatically and Rear Panel also got opened automatically..,I didn't charge it for 2 days, now after charging also it is not getting on,I have been using this watch since a month and its really great.

 will share detailed review once use it for atleast a week.,Good watch through fire =% boultI am impressed for this watch is so computableand all features are properly working like mean feature voice calling are properly working andThis price range are no any brand are give this feature I am Happy for this watchThank you Fire =% boult,Pros: The phone supports both phone and apps calling. Has long charge. Phone finder,  phone camera shutter are good features. Beautiful looking watch.Cons: Not a full screen display, display is smaller than the watch. My watch is not center alligned. Limited number of watch face. Sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch. Phone book should be a little larger than 8 numbers.,Just bought it ,so my review is basically the first impression.I will write a detailed review after few days of use. I like the style and it looks good. So far touch operation is also good,It's good product in this range because I have one more of pebble smart watch in same price range but after using fire boltt it's better. Only one issue that not stop call ring during office or meeting time.,I liked Everything except Hearbeat and O2 Level accuracy but it's close to real levels so average in this respect. Otherwise it's a kill for the money !!! Very good overall.,The product is good as per the price charged. One feedback to supplier to improve the glass of watch, there are lots of scratches within one month of usage.,All is good. Satisfied. Auto selection of sport mode is not there.

 but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with themHighly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31GUbeFG3FL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Airdopes-141-Playtime-Resistance-Bluetooth/dp/B09N3ZNHTY/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1672902995&s=computers&sr=1-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,

 will share detailed review once use it for atleast a week.,Good watch through fire =% boultI am impressed for this watch is so computableand all features are properly working like mean feature voice calling are properly working andThis price range are no any brand are give this feature I am Happy for this watchThank you Fire =% boult,Pros: The phone supports both phone and apps calling. Has long charge. Phone finder,  phone camera shutter are good features. Beautiful looking watch.Cons: Not a full screen display, display is smaller than the watch. My watch is not center alligned. Limited number of watch face. Sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch. Phone book should be a little larger than 8 numbers.,Just bought it ,so my review is basically the first impression.I will write a detailed review after few days of use. I like the style and it looks good. So far touch operation is also good,It was a awesome watch... I liked it sleep monitoring it's accurate. According to me this worth buying and I would suggest anyone who is reading this review to go ahead and buy this watch,It's good product in this range because I have one more of pebble smart watch in same price range but after using fire boltt it's better. Only one issue that not stop call ring during office or meeting time.,I liked Everything except Hearbeat and O2 Level accuracy but it's close to real levels so average in this respect. Otherwise it's a kill for the money !!! Very good overall.,The product is good as per the price charged. One feedback to supplier to improve the glass of watch, there are lots of scratches within one month of usage.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Mce3f9faL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Fire-Boltt-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-Calling-Assistance/dp/B09YV4MW2T/ref=sr_1_30?qid=1672902996&s=computers&sr=1-30;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,

 black and blue. I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three. That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. This leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.Pros:1) No metal build2) Excellent wire quality and trendy3) Durable4) Above average sound qualityCons:1) Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2) Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3) Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyI hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads 220. All suggestions are welcome.Thanking you, Dwarakesh,Best quality  I like boat earphone saund quality,Only disadvantage  I noticed was this can't be use in USB phones,  3.5 mm jack is provided so it can be  usedin Jack phones only .,Nice,good,I used this headphone for travel. Very lite and easy to carry in pocket. colourful. Sound quality is good. The wire is thin so i feel cautious  While taking it from bag or pocket.,Gd one!

very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31zOsqQOAOL._SY445_SX342_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Ambrane-Unbreakable-Charging-Braided-Cable/dp/B098NS6PVG/ref=sr_1_41?qid=1672902996&s=computers&sr=1-41;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,

Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ¹99/- with the offers and so I wasnt sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhones battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ¹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesnt tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesnt get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31VzNhhqifL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-POR-1080-Charging-Function/dp/B08CF3B7N1/ref=sr_1_51?qid=1672902997&s=computers&sr=1-51;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,

 considering the current work-from-home scenario which is bound to continue for the foreseeable future as well, the internet usage was being stretched to it's limit and the trusted Netgear router simply couldn't match up to the increased bandwidth demand.To capitalise on the current situation, our current ISP came out with interesting Fibre broadband plans and we opted for a 75 mbps connection. That in turn needed a new router to utilize it's optimum potential. Finally zeroed in on the TP-Link Archer C80 after reading some horror stories of other available routers. Was also tempted to buy the AX1500 considering there's barely any price difference, but then came across a few reviews which stated that Wifi 6 is not entirely successfully implemented and might prove to be an hindrance to use with our current range of devices.Order delivered by Amazon within a day. Full marks for the seamless delivery as always. Prime has truly been a boon.Installed the Router today. Installation via Tether App was seamless. ISP guy helped with the PPPOE sign-in process and released the MAC ID which was bound to our old Router. The whole process was done in 10 mins and we were online.The dual bands are truly a boon. Have divided the devices at home equally between 2.4G and 5G as per usage. As the router is close to the TV unit, have connected it to 5G and also alternatively connected via the Ethernet cable (just in case).Speed tests:Started off by streaming 4k content simultaneously on 2 devices connected to 5G. Played seamlessly even with other devices like mobiles etc being connected.Have attached a few pictures for reference.- Sitting near the Router, 5G Download speed is 77 mbps and Upload is 75.4 mbps.- 5G speed tested in the bedroom with a wall in between: Download 72.4 mbps and Upload 74.9 mbps.- 2.4G speed in the same room as the Router is: Download 68.3 mbps and Upload 79.2 mbps. (This is quite surprising as a few reviews mentioned 50-55 mbps will be the threshold for 2.4G. Used to get a maximum of 45 mbps download on my old N300).- Speed Test via the Ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the TV: Download 78 mbps and Upload 75 mbps.Couldn't have asked for more really. This seems to be totally ideal.Build quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job, however would have preferred that they were placed like other TP-Link models like the Archer A6, so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directions.The LED lights are a little weirdly placed and not bright enough. Maybe I'm used to the prominent lights on my old Router. These are a blink-and-miss sort and you have to bend a little to check in case there's an issue. One big element missing in this device is a USB port which is absolutely essential in today's age and expected to be included for this price range. Wonder what's the reason behind giving it a miss.I have sealed the extra LAN ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture. It's a good practice. The outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish, however I'm a little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portion.Functionally though, this seems to be a real good offering from TP-Link. Hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days. All-in-all, seems to be a worthy investment for the next few years, considering an internet plan upgrade, if any.Hope I touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making a choice. This product is RECOMMENDED! :),https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41c7bJo7ooL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-Archer-C20-Wireless-Router/dp/B0759QMF85/ref=sr_1_187?qid=1672903004&s=computers&sr=1-187;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
 whereas MK270 takes 1 battery.4. Mouse is shaped different - lower arch and wider - which may simply take adjusting. Feels a little cheaper.While a real review can only be provided much later - seeing how keys/clicks perform over the long run (and one hopes that Logitech will have taken care of that quality) - while I don't have any complaints so far, I feel paying a bit extra for the MK270 may suit many folks out there. Hope the review helps - will update later if I see find any fundamental issues with time.,Product is good but lagging very much.Not enjoying/ satisfied with this product.Bad  for me==.,It is working fine till now.,The keyboard is good but pretty small when compared with regular keyboards. It works well and keys and ok.,Excellent,Go fot it good product, handy.. just connector is little bit big size,Works properly.Initially noticed lag and then looked it up online.It seems USB receiver faces interference when another port next to it is plugged in to other device.I had the lag of both mouse and keyboard actions but noticed that my USB receiver was plugged next to HDMI port which was also connected to a monitor. I switched the USB receiver to another USB port on other side of laptop without any neighboring ports. Don't face lag now.Try to use a USB hub if you don't have a USB port away from existing used ports.,Build quality and all are good but the batteries cap is little bit loose for the keyboard and mouse is totally fine.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31SAqKSRWyL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Logitech-MK215-Wireless-Keyboard-Mouse/dp/B012MQS060/ref=sr_1_190?qid=1672903004&s=computers&sr=1-190;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,

 it would have a long term durability also.,This is an awesome product that I have purchased till date for my WFH purpose. It can hold 14 Laptop very well. It can be adjusted for different heights. Grip to the table is really good. It helps to view the laptop with required angle. Easy to carry. Looks really great on a black table. Classic silver piece. Packaging is also very good.,3.5 starsI got this delivered today and tried it out. My laptop is 2.5 KG and 17 inches, a bit of a heavy machine.While the stand held my laptop, it did not fit properly. Because of the laptop's weight or the size, the front of the laptop raises instead of staying on the padded notches. Have to move the machine forward a bit for it to stay on.If you want to use it as simply a stand - where you set the laptop and use external devices to use it like the mouse, gamepad or the keyboard, it is fine. You can go for it.If you want to use the machine itself when on the stand - touchpad and keyboard, you might face some issues. Using it directly is making the machine a bit wobbly.Will test it out with heavy work / gaming to see how the temperature holds. Might edit the review and the rating after using it a bit.,The product itself is awesome and in modern day where ease to carry and compact products are preferred it is a good choice , my only reason to give 4 stars and removing one out of five is the product latches (linkages/arms that set the level of elevation angle ) are bit free And can be undone from one of either side with a slight jerk while the second side latch supports all the weight in the meantime.,It is very convenient and compact to carry along with you.

199.00 for it on on 29 Sep, 2019. The cam's design is streamlined and sophisticated, and the plug-and-play feature is quite useful. It was a great option at a price of ¹ 1,199 in 2019 but now there are better options available. Don't fall for good reviews most of them are old.Be smart you can use the Droidcam software to configure your Android phone as a webcam if you have brief video calls, such as an interview or exam. A Lenovo 300 FHD webcam with a wide-angle vision and stronger mics makes more sense if you want to invest a little money. Spend the money on Logitech C920 or C922 if you really want to start a live stream or tutorial videos that are more professional; you won't regret. If you already have a point and shoot camera or DSLR at home, get a cheap capture card so you can set it up as a webcam.Pros:Simple plug-and-play is available.The camera offers a regular mode and a wide angle option.The Universal Clip prevents the robust cam from toppling.The green led indicates whether or not the camera is active.Cons:Incompatible with bezel-less displays.The picture and mic quality is poor.Face recognition is too bad.The image will be grainy and noisy.¹ 1,699  seriously no!!!!Conclusion:Choose it if there is no better choice available between ¹500 and ¹1200. It will assist you momentarily. You need enough lighting, and you shouldn't rely on the webcam's microphone.,Does the job.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/316Q0fvU+2L._SY300_SX300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Logitech-C270-HD-Webcam-Black/dp/B008QS9J6Y/ref=sr_1_230?qid=1672903006&s=computers&sr=1-230;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,

At first i would like to suggest to look for the rating of the seller selling electronic products, before ordering this i ordered a similiar product crucial ssd500gb but instead i got a toshiba hdd of 500 gb that too loaded with photo and word document of some guy. I contacted amazon and they refunded me right away. Then i placed this order after searching for rating of this seller, which i found legit..

 and it does the same job as the original one.,Useful for c type charging. But not suitable with all adapters or USB points. Serves the purpose.,Sturdily built. Does its job well. Charged my Samsung Galaxy M51 quicker than the original cable. Hope it stays the same going ahead.,Liked the charging speed disliked the length. On iPads this is awesome but its is not 6 foot long so this the only point to think otherwise it is the best cable,Good,Everything is good including connectivity and stuff,Nice product..im using this for my car,This product is nice and worth the amount...I recommend it to anyone who are looking for this kind of cable,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41P2EdQI1ZL._SY445_SX342_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Sounce-Type-C-Compatible-Smartphone-Charging/dp/B09RZS1NQT/ref=sr_1_280?qid=1672903008&s=computers&sr=1-280;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,

 I had to take off my iPad cover to enable the application, the previous one wouldnt align with the cover in place. Adhesion of the first one gave up as soon as I tried to lift and reapply, again might be attributable to the fact that I didnt get rid of the dust particles like I should have.The one that I successfully applied, works just fine.,Good product. Decent alignment.,great product, theres no such anti glare thing, also not really good for using apple pencil, i mean the surface is not paper like thats why, one more thing it gets fingerprints really fast&application is very easy but take care there is no dust on the ipad because if a bubbles formed you CANNOT correct it,Good,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VIQVc-6XL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/ESR-iPad-Screen-Protector-Scratch-Resistant/dp/B07TMCXRFV/ref=sr_1_372?qid=1672903013&s=computers&sr=1-372;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,
 Entire build is made of plastic which is fine but for me monitor was always a little tilted no matter how hard I screwed the stand it was still the same.4. AMD Freesync isn't much affective, you can still see screen tearing.5. Stand Movement is very stiff, I almost felt like I broke it. Just bad build quality.If you are only going to use HDMI port and find a workaround for audio then alright but for someone who games on PC and console both this is not good enough.If you are willing to sacrifice little bit of Visual quality and 15Hz of refresh rate which is not noticeable at all then go for BenQ, Same price but less hassle.OrBetter bump up your budget go for LG 24MK600M which goes for 13k or less but worth it,,It could have one more HDMI port,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vMbxznwhL._SY88.jpg,Perfect monitor for editing and casual gaming,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417vDmMtbpL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-inch-Bezel-Flicker-Monitor-LF24T350FHWXXL/dp/B08J82K4GX/ref=sr_1_379?qid=1672903013&s=computers&sr=1-379;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,
 so 2.2Ah will take 4.4hrs, considering losses 4.5hrs. That's why frequent power cut ppl r complaining about 1hr standby. So its basically for ppl with occasional power cuts (like me with community generator).3. Ups has to be turned ON to recharge... what? why? lame! This is another reason ppl r complaining about charging issue & since item is generic, ZINQ prolly doesn't even know... lol... such a dumb thing must be printed on the center of the box itself. I myself was fooled for 6hrs thinking that its charging but it went cold so checked with power meter & wow! It didn't charge a bit.4. Had i been younger with lotza free time, i could've made one myself for ¹80+80+80+150+50 for 1.8Ah one... Gone r those fun days! So I'm keeping it for ¹1001.** if any1 is reading my review, youtube search for router ups & lotza young ppl with free time have made such DIY.===============Damn this thing can output over 35watts of power @12v. For the 1st time something has out-specked my 35w load tester.Pros-1. Can output 3A or even more, that i could test. Great for sudden load surge.2. Very stable output 12-12.1v throughout 0-35w.3. Solid built, almost all possible connectors provided, seamless switching from AC to battery (obviously), easy to use.Cons-1. No polarity changing option for in/out. Some items/chargers do have center negative, for that i have to make my own cable.2. Since it went 3A or above, i dont think theres any overload/short circuit protection.3. Item got quite hot when run at 12v 2A for 15mins. I hope theres thermal protection.4. Item is sealed shut. Any repair or future battery change will be destructive.,It works as intended and gives 4-5 hours battery backup for wi-fi.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4148+QSBxXL._SY300_SX300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Zinq-Technologies-ZQ-6600-Intercom-Set-top/dp/B08FGNPQ9X/ref=sr_1_383?qid=1672903013&s=computers&sr=1-383;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,

I am not used since it restricted in my system.,I have used it with HP and Dell Laptop. Its compatible with all. Its plug and play and easy to use.,Good product,It works perfectly,A trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable. It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product:1) There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when Im working at night.2) The cable is flat, which is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when its not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product wouldve been a perfect 5/5 if TP Link didnt make these strange design decisions. Hope this helps.

 I am able to get the clear screen which is quite frustrating and I think this might be a battery issue and if it is then company should work on that. Also this erase button wipes out everything at once so no scope of making mistake, you cannot erase any particular info on screen, the complete screen erases at once. Otherwise it's very handy, saves lot of paper for rough work and a good product in this range when compared to other ruffpads.,ok for remainder,Good one.It should have pen holder,First impressions are awesome.hope  it work well for one year >z>z build quality amazing all amazing simply go For it,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41NxAkv7knL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Ruffpad-Re-Writable-15-inch-Handwriting/dp/B08XNL93PL/ref=sr_1_407?qid=1672903014&s=computers&sr=1-407;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,

 I had noticed that the cartridges did not have the protective tape over them. Didnt think much of it then.It feels like this was a printer that was being used somewhere and they put it into a new box when shipping. Or someone opened a new box, inserted used cartridges, and took out the new ones.The scanner also does not seem to work.The printing is fine and works. I think the problem is with the company that sold and shipped it to me  somethings amiss here.,It's nice but take time to installation which cause trouble at once after that it's easy to use,Best one for home need!,Got delivered today and I set up using the cable and fired few prints.. Print quality is good. Need to see how long the catridge lasts..but for home purpose and medium usage I think it works,There is some serious issue with the product, it is not working now, need service engineer to repair it.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31ulmi5lTYL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/HP-DeskJet-2723-Wireless-Printer/dp/B08D9MNH4B/ref=sr_1_418?qid=1672903016&s=computers&sr=1-418;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,

 its just a treat for bass lovers.ÏÏ WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ÏÏSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :----------------------------------Ï boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.Ï JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.Ï Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :PNOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.ÏÏ WINNER - boAt 225 ÏÏCUSTOMER CARE :--------------------Ï boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.Ï JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.Ï Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.ÏÏ WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ÏÏCONNECTIVITY :------------------All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.VERDICT :----------I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.Hope this review helps you make sound decision.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31VnhITYb+L._SY300_SX300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-CX-80s-Ear-Earphone/dp/B083T5G5PM/ref=sr_1_438?qid=1672903017&s=computers&sr=1-438;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,

 sticks tightly and easy to strap.

Little expensive but I don't have time to find it in my locality and quality is also good.,These are strong and better than plastic tags which you normally use to keep wires in order.

 it is light weight, and came with a good pouch to carry.One area of improvement - you always need both the hands to adjust the height with laptop off. And if you are moving it, the level of height / adjustment will collapse. I would have liked if the height was lockable so that if you are moving the stand will not collapse.,The produt is good,value for money,Its better you get a wooden one.Its hard to adjust, feels cheap quality.If you have requirement to move it around, don't buy this. If you get some offer and would not be moving this around much.

 a portion of one side bunrs the milk. Even while boiling water I can see the similar symptom.,Agaro Multicooker is good and gives a variety of cooking/ boiling options like Milk, Tea, Eggs, Maggi, etc.Only negative point is that Agaro team promises extended warranty of 6 months by giving asking to give a positive review on Amazon but fails to deliver on their promise and does not give any extended warranty.,Delivery has safe got item safely.Delivery on time, instantaneous water boiling sufficient space big volume best for hostel students.Hope for warranty and company response.,I liked how fast it does the work but i hate about the dirt it gets inside after cooking something, it sticks their,Overall gorgeous product.

Loving this product while using,It does the job pretty well.The cons according to me are 1. You cannot use it with clothes placed on horizontal flat surfaces. Because the water doesnt reach the outlet in the tank if the tank is half empty. The alternative is that the dress has to be hanged to a cloth hanger and then use the steamer.2. Be careful while steaming as it may burn the skin. Keep you palm at a safe distance while steaming the dress. This may be an issue when you try to steam the sleeves of the garment and also for flowing dresses.3. Not all fabrics can be completely wrinkle free.4. It sometimes leaves more steam and water at times leaving your garment with wet patches. The garment feels wet after using the steamer.5. You have to keep filling the tank twice for using it on one top.,Easy to use, sturdy, and does the job, only thing is that it takes time to cool, rest of all good,Its an amazing product and easy to use.

Firstly I faced issue while starting the Nutri blender as it didn't start on it's own, I need to hold it tightly then it started to run. Otherwise the product is good overall.,It is good for grinding and blending for small quantities.It is easy to use .Cleaning is also easy .It is best for making juices,smoothies and all types of chutneys. I do my cooking my cooking work fast with the help of this product as it takes less time to chop .I recommended this product,Product size is small but product quality is not good I used this product for 3 months and problems have arrived soon. Sometimes the blender doesn't work and all the time some black grease like substance keep coming out and get mixed with food.,Like it and recommend it,Small jar not working .....,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gZhEcCCQL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Wonderchef-Nutri-Blend-Watts-Juicer-Grinder/dp/B00W56GLOQ/ref=sr_1_76?qid=1672923595&s=kitchen&sr=1-76;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,

 they refused to change the rod free of cost. They are saying that rod is not under warranty. Only Box is under warranty. Maharaja is a cheater company.,The concern first,base of the heater is made of plastic and plastic base needs to be screwed with the metallic heater body with 2 screws. Since heater body is metallic, tall and has weight, the connection with plastic base doesn't feel robust/durable enough as it shakes when touched.Else all looks good and rest depends on how long it lasts.,The stand needs to be more sturdy as it leans back on flat surface. Otherwise this is a good product for a 15x15 ft room @1200W.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Y4vsQHt6L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Maharaja-Whiteline-Lava-1200-Watt-Helogen/dp/B00KRCBA6E/ref=sr_1_101?qid=1672923595&s=kitchen&sr=1-101;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,

 50gm oats, milks and 15gm nuts.

Over all good product.bEasy to install,Well designed product. Yet, to experience filter replacement and, consequently, the recurring cost.,The product is working nicely and worth buying product.,Writing after almost 1.5 years all pros n cons Everything is good only problem is i live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around 2000 and it took only 6-8 months it become totally black few advice1. Dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon n pores will b blocked.2. If you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners.3. Seal your doors most dirt & mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them.4. Run it all day as when u turn it iff after 1 hour your room will be as dirty as ut was.5. You can clean pre filter only don't clean carbon and hepa filter.6. Being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it 4-5 times keep it under sun light for 4-5 hours.7. Sometimes u get error of FO clean all three filter with vaccume or brush (careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask) after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working8. Bhai delhi m pollution bhot h so family k lie monthly 300rs padta h filter mother wife bachy pura din gher p rhty h so its a must buy to protect them.9. Update fan speed got slow down10. Power consumption- on 1st- 23 watt, 2nd- 33 watt, 3rd 40 watt, max 50 watt best is keep it on automatic mode when room will be clean power consumption will reduced to 23watt and whole night it work in power efficient mode11.

 with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max (80 to 90%) juice out of fruits and veggies. The look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are available,I have been using this for a month now.It is easy to use, and clean and assemble.But at times, I have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes a different sound while it is grinding.I feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut a bit smaller and not like a slice, cause if i cut like a slice/flat, one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made a different sound and it was not giving more juice but i could see the pulp.Try to cut the carrot pieces of atleast 1-2 inch size like a round one and not like a slicebut overall, good experience as i make carrot and beatroot juice and  it takes 15-20 minutes to cut, grind and clean.very easy to use and very easy to assemble.Thanks,Perfect home juicer , easy to clean, assemble and comparable i loves it,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31-jt474B1L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Philips-Viva-Collection-HR1832-1-5-Litre400-Watt/dp/B00S9BSJC8/ref=sr_1_238?qid=1672923603&s=kitchen&sr=1-238;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,

But the construction of the blender is such that the food often falls below the blades and I am constantly readjusting the ingredients to get the ingredients blended. It can take a considerable amount of time and a lot of patience. But this immersion blender can puree fruits and vegetables in less than 2 minutes and do it evenly and consistently. It is easy to use and lightweight. Cleaning consists of removing the shaft with the blades and handwashing it. You can wipe off the handle with a damp cloth and stick both in a drawer. My standard blender requires thorough washing of the various parts (pitcher, blades, screw on attachment, and lid). So I am moving the standard blender from the counter to storage. If I need it I have it. I highly recommend this Powerful blender, go for it.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41QEK7WRJbL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Inalsa-Robot-1000-800-Watt-Blender/dp/B0747VDH9L/ref=sr_1_269?qid=1672923605&s=kitchen&sr=1-269;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,

 this poor small machine can't handle a 100% cleaning on that.If the car is heavily soiled the you must get it cleaned at a professional clearner then start using the small one.I found this to be doing the job when compared to my house vaccum clearner.One thing I observed was the wires was getting hot and has a soft component which makes it even thinner when it's hit but I think I can handle the job, accessories quality is good and fir and finishe is good.I did not seen any dust seeping through the compartment and it was well contained in the dust chamber.Suction is decent and you can give almost a clean and tidy look to your car with this machine, again a professional grade cleaners can doa good job which cost nothing less tha 15K.I would say worth a buy it used delligently by not expecting too much.I only hope if the company can provide a bag to carry it for the price or find one in your own which can fit your needs.,Perfect,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41lZEy8e9DL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Eureka-Forbes-Vacuum-Cleaner-Washable/dp/B08L12N5H1/ref=sr_1_295?qid=1672923607&s=kitchen&sr=1-295;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,

I am updating my review, hope it will get published and the who's and who of the brand will pay attention to it. After every two to three months the unit is having problem with the inlet system. Many a times, the inlet stops taking water but the indicator shows tank filling! It was rectified by the service person. Again, now the indicator showing tank filling while the inlet valve is shut! It should show the purple light means low or no pressure. It's a faulty unit. The installation guy and the service persons were right who stated that the faulty and low quality units are sold online, whose statement I ignored thinking that every offline seller says so. Alas, I was wrong. I want this unit to be removed immediately and want my hard earned money back.,At this price this product is very suitable.,Esy to install,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31TnmukIucL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Eureka-Forbes-Aquaguard-boiling-Technology/dp/B096NTB9XT/ref=sr_1_346?qid=1672923610&s=kitchen&sr=1-346;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,

 rest all good,Suction power is okayish. Its a good product, value for money but can do much better with a good suction power. It doesnt remove most of the dust takes too much effort,It is a good choice if you are looking for a vacuum cleaner under 5k. It is worth for the price.,nice product worth the money,Suction power is good, cord length sufficient for home purpose, noise level is also low right now,Please go for it.

 I finally took the leap and bought the 13 fin Volcano from Borosil. It has transformed the way with its reliability and efficiency.Packaging:The item was secured and packed very well with amazon packaging along with the original Borosil Packaging.Assembly:Using the provided guidebook was easy to understand. The unit comes as assembled but you have to attach the castor wheels which was pretty easy. Then all was left was to plug it in.Usage:The heater warmed up the 20ftx20ft room with relative ease. It has 3 power levels for the fan attached and a temperature regulator. The heater takes 5-6 minutes to heat up and bring the room up to temperature.Looks:The product looks very well and the black fin structure helps meld well with any decor you have in your room.Additionally, the two-year warranty and the safety features make it a must-buy product for winters.9/10 would buy again,Did not give the expected result,Ordered this OFR a month ago and have had used it since then. It is a powerful product to warm up the room pretty quickly. Although the first few minutes are slow but then it picks up the pace and evenly heats up the entire room. It is quite and doesn't even vibrate. I already own an OTG and an egg boiler and now the OFR. Borosil has stood up to the mark providing good quality appliances at a decent price tag.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qqrzjPySL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Borosil-Volcano-Filled-Radiator-Heater/dp/B09M3F4HGB/ref=sr_1_371?qid=1672923611&s=kitchen&sr=1-371;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,

 it disperses enough water, fast, within 30 minutes you'll have several liters of water to drink.Also, the main thing about this is it is CHEMICAL FREE! - it also filters out VIRUSES!

Since i got this cartridge delivery, i didn't need to run to the store.,Really liked the product..... But amazon packing is really made me disappointed... Really broken a trust on Amazon..... Filter kits were completely separated from the box cause the external box was too small and made the filter kits squeeze completely... I just pulled the filter kits to get it's normal size....

The water gets extremely hot when given in hot mode and quickly gets cold when cold water option is switched.Ideal should be: like geyser, it should have the option for both hot and cold water running parallelly so that a nice warm water flows and things get done.One cannot wash dishes with hand when water is very hot or very cold,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41A6EmdtN8L._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/NEXOMS-Instant-Heating-Mounted-Stainless/dp/B07G147SZD/ref=sr_1_389?qid=1672923611&s=kitchen&sr=1-389;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,

Easy to use,Product of good use. Wish the Handle of the roller was easy  to use,We have a beagle dog so we have extensive use of lint rollers in the household. Have been using the 3M, but its very expensive if you consume 4to 5 rollers every month. So thought of trying this one as i though how bad can a lint roller be. The stickiness of the glue paper was good enough to remove the dog hair, but the quality of the handle is really bad. It did not even last 2 days. So ended up using a wooden stick or long pencils for the job. If the makers had spent some more on making a good handle even if the cost would have been Rs 25 higher, then it could have been a great product especially for those households which have pets as they need it more frequently. So i might go back to buying the 3M product of look for something in between.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Fo2P8-4ZL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Bulfyss-Plastic-Remover-Cleaner-Remover/dp/B07HK53XM4/ref=sr_1_428?qid=1672923613&s=kitchen&sr=1-428;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,

Delivery: Amazon delivery is always reliable and it didnt fail me this time too..Packaging: Both outer packing and the product packaging were intact. Product packing had the right information and was very usefulProduct: Very compact. We used several coffee makers in the market, but all required electricity to run. We wanted to have a non electric one which we can easily carry for outdoor and this one fits aptly to our requirements. Just add the coffee powder and hot water. After a while when we press the central pipe, coffee comes out. The nozzle makes it convenient to pour it a cup.For this price in great India sale, I think its worth. I am inclined to give 5 star, but reserving 1 star now. Will use it for a month and come back here to change my rating if it still satisfies me.,Good one for a Black coffee lover,Very very happy with Cafe JEI's French Press.

the material is flimsy and cardboard is not strong.. the side latch or handle stitched is not the strong. A box can't hold the weight when its full. Cheap price cheap value.,Appears to be very weak,may get damaged with in a few days of usage.Hence returned it.,Too early to question its durability. However, it looks sturdy. It is bit different from the product image as you can see in my pictures the entire top isnt designed as projected, thats a bummer. Good for small families only.,Good product.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416VJv+z7CL._SY300_SX300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/PrettyKrafts-Laundry-Foldable-Multipurpose-Slanting/dp/B09HS1NDRQ/ref=sr_1_454?qid=1672923614&s=kitchen&sr=1-454;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,
 however, is not capable of doing anything other than boiling or scrambling / poaching eggs but the cleaning after scrambling / poaching eggs is very cumbersome and hence it is best if not used for these purposes. For me it is only suitable for half-boiled eggs.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31afXBXOUVL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Glen-Electric-Multi-Cooker-Boiler/dp/B09FPP3R1D/ref=sr_1_456?qid=1672923614&s=kitchen&sr=1-456;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,

 but its minute only, so no worries, says a little about quality control. But its not a trade of really.And just as any other stainless steel utensils get stains at the bottom on boiling water, this one too.So my opinion, use soft water and avoid hard water.And ohh forgot to mention, there is a thermoplastic egg tray given with and easy carry stick, that you have to assemble.Overall a good buy,Nice product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/414WPLTqm0L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Borosil-Rio-1-5L-Electric-Kettle/dp/B07VZYMQNZ/ref=sr_1_479?qid=1672923615&s=kitchen&sr=1-479;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,

 it is battery-operated, no charging cable connection is available.But overall it is working fine for me in this amount.,Just 30 Seconds and frothy coffee ready.Very powerful.. .. easy to operate as well...the main body of the frother could be made of a better material,Nice product,Product is ok. Does a decent job of frothing. However, the built quality appears to be flimsy. Plastic is quite cheap and delicate. Have to see how long it lasts.Also the seller promises cashback for giving 5 star reviews so all the reviews may not be genuine..,I like it because it is easy toh use and dislike because it doesn't come with batteries,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HzkPoNUzL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Electric-Handheld-BLACK-COFFEE-BEATER/dp/B0B8CB7MHW/ref=sr_1_491?qid=1672923617&s=kitchen&sr=1-491;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,
